# fish_detection

This repository contains my initial work in Computer Vision aimed at detecting a specific type of fish from underwater camera feeds. The code utilizes histogram [backprojection](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/df6/tutorial_py_histogram_backprojection.html) (not backpropagation) in OpenCV to identify similar regions within an entire video.
